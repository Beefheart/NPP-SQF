# NPP-SQF
SQF-Language for Notepad++ for Solarized (dark) theme

I prefer using NPP with Ethan Schoonover's Solarized (dark) theme and it's always been a pain with the official NPP-SQF style from the original author. So I decided to alter the languages stype to match Solarized (dark).
Maybe there is a better way for the implementation but I am not aware of that atm.
